## Create your first globaldce decentralized application

Having completed the steps in the getting started document youâ€™re ready to build your first app. To illustrate the process we will build a simple hello world decentralized application.

We will start by registering a globaldce blockchain domain name. Run the globaldec gateway in gui mode. Make sure you have a positive balance, then go in the registration section and registre a domain name you like. After that the domain registration will be confirmed, your domain name will be listed in registration section along with its folder path.

Next, create a simple html file named index.html that contain basic html code. Just create a new text file called index.html in your favorite text editor and copy paste the following html code:

```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My first decentralized application</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is my personal decentralized application.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
Save this index.html file in the folder of your domain.

Finally in the registration section select your domain name and click push. Because your are the sole owner of this domain this folder content will be automatically assigned to that domain name. Anyone using the globladce browser extension will be able to access your content by entering in the address bar * followed by your domain name.
